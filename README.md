<h4>What was our problem statement and how did I approach it:-</h4>
<p>So we had a problem statement that we have to create a clone of a website called groww.com .<br>
Also, We can only use my HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript knowledge. We were five members in our group.</p>

<h4>How We divided the work in our Team members:-</h4>
<hr>
<p>As we were five members in our team so it was very important to decide how we will approach the work so that<br>

in the future we should not face any problem in merging the code, as well as the tasks, get divided into equal<br>

parts.So, on the first day, As a team leader, I made a git repository and everyone was told to make their separate<br>

git branch by cloning the repo and push their work there and when they feel that they have completed it.They can show<br>

it to one of the members(team leader) and after the approval, they can merge their code to the main branch.I was mainly<br>

responsible for making the Product page and navigation bar and script part which are similar on all the pages.<br>

And my other team members were responsible for the login page, landing page, and Cart page and make the page look better.</p>
